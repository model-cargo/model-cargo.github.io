If you are a VAT-registered business, you can expect a VAT inspection at some point in time, by officers from the UAEâ€™s Federal Tax Authority (FTA).

Do not panic. VAT inspections are routine checks conducted by the tax authority to review your VAT records and ensure whether they are correct or not. As such, it is best to be always prepared to ensure you avoid the potential of penalties imposed by the FTA.
